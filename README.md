 Speech-to-Text Projects Collection
This repository contains a series of projects developed to demonstrate the use of Speech-to-Text (STT) systems in various domains. The focus is on integrating accurate speech recognition models with practical real-world applications, using command recognition, transcription, and automation.

🔔 Project 1: Speech-to-Text Controlled Alarm System Using "On" and "Stop" Commands
Description
This project demonstrates a simple voice-controlled automation system where users can activate or deactivate an alarm using spoken commands "on" and "stop". It leverages speech recognition to convert commands to text and triggers actions accordingly.

Features
Voice-activated alarm system

Command recognition using Google Speech Commands dataset

Real-time response to user input

Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow / PyTorch

Google Speech Commands Dataset

Numpy, Librosa, Matplotlib

How It Works
Preprocess audio data using MFCCs.

Train a neural network model to recognize the commands "on" and "stop".

Continuously listen for input and activate/deactivate the alarm accordingly.

🎙️ Project 2: Speech-to-Text using Google Speech Commands
Description
This project builds a robust speech-to-text engine focused on recognizing short commands using the Google Speech Commands dataset. It aims to explore the basics of speech recognition with small vocabulary size.

Features
Trainable on custom or preselected keyword classes

Visualization of spectrograms and MFCCs

Real-time inference demo

Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow / PyTorch

Google Speech Commands Dataset

SciPy, Librosa, Scikit-learn

How It Works
Audio preprocessing with noise augmentation and MFCC extraction.

Model training using CNN/RNN architectures.

Live or offline speech command transcription.

☎️ Project 3: Speech-to-Text Transcription System for Customer Service Automation (IVR Systems)
Description
This project focuses on developing a noise-robust speech-to-text transcription system tailored for use in Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems for customer service. It targets conversational audio in potentially noisy environments.

Features
Transcription of customer interactions

Noise-robust audio preprocessing

Language model integration for improved accuracy

Technologies Used
Python

DeepSpeech / Wav2Vec 2.0 / Whisper

Custom IVR Dataset

NLTK / SpaCy for NLP integration

How It Works
Clean and preprocess noisy IVR recordings.

Use pretrained or fine-tuned speech-to-text models.

Apply language modeling to correct transcription and enhance contextual accuracy.
